PEL Test Suite
**************

This directory holds the SimpleTest test suite for PEL.  The test
suite consists of a number of core tests which exercise the basic
functionality of PEL.

In addition to the core tests, one can download a set of image tests.
These consist of example images taken from as many different camera
models as possible together with a test case that will ensure that PEL
can read the data in the image, and that it keeps interpreting the
data in the same way.  This ensures stability in the development
process by making sure that PEL keeps reading images in the same way.

The image tests are not distributed with PEL, but can be found at

  http://pel.sourceforge.net/


Running the Test Suite
**********************

First the SimpleTest framework has to be downloaded via composer in 
the project's top directory

```bash
composer update
```
Now run the run-tests.php script and observe the results --- it should
tell you that all tests were executed successfully.

You can run a subset of the available tests by giving the file names
as command line arguments to run-tests.php.


Failing Tests
*************

Should one or more of the tests fail, then first ensure that
SimpleTest is placed correctly so that run-tests.php can find it. If
everything seems correct, then please report the error to the PEL
Development List:

  http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pel-devel

or use the SourceForge tracker system found here

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=108380

Remember to include all the output in your bug report.
